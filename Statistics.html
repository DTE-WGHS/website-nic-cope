		<p>This page includes a range of statistics that are related to plastics in the ocean as well as how much plastic is in the ocean. 
		<br> 	
		<h3>How much plastic is in the ocean?</h3>
		Approximately 150 million tonnes of plastic has already accumulated in the ocean and if nothing changes, it is estimated that by the year 2050, the weight of plastic in the sea will weigh more fish. Currently floating around in the world’s oceans/seas is approximately 5.25 trillion plastic particles.
		<br>
		<br>
		Major rivers from around the world are estimates to carry 1.15 – 2.41 million tonnes of plastic to sea. This is the equivalent to around 100,000 rubbish trucks. Approximately every year, 10 – 20 million tonnes of plastic ends up in the ocean - that’s a full rubbish truck or more every minute - through multiple sources like rivers, coastal urban centres sewage systems, road run-off and littering just to name a few. New research has shown that since the 1950’s, we have produced plastic as heavy as 1 billion elephants. Often ending up in landfills or in the ocean is 91% of the plastic produced around the world which means that only 9% of plastic is being recycled. 
		<br>
		<br>
		During the 2016 International Coastal Clean-up, if all the plastic bottles were stacked, they would’ve stood 372 times higher than Dubai’s 828 metre high Burj Khalifa. If all the straws that were collected off beaches worldwide, they would’ve stood 145 times higher than the 541-metre-high One World Trade Centre in New York. If all of the plastic utensils that were collected from around the world were stacked, they would’ve stood 82 times higher than Kuala Lumper’s 452 metre high Petronas Towers, and if all of the cigarette lighters were collected and stacked, they would’ve stood 10 times higher than the 324 metre high Eiffel Tower in Paris.
		<br>
		<br>
		One beach clean-up findings included 4.3 million plastic lids, 1.8 million cigarette butts, 1.5 million plastic beverage bottles, 800 000 plastic bottle caps, 700 000 food wrappers, 52 000 plastic grocery bags, 4 000 plastic straws and stirrers, and 3 400 glass beverage bottles.
		<br>
		<br>
		Globally, the plastic that is produced, adds up to approximately 300 million tonnes. Around half of that plastic is being used for items that will be disposed after they have been used once. An estimated $13 billion dollars in losses per year can be linked to marine plastic debris due to the negative impact on the marine ecosystems.

		<p><h3>What is the most common type of plastic that ends up in the ocean?</h3>
		Some of the most common items found in ocean and coastal surveys are single-use food and beverage containers. The disintegration of large plastic items such as carrier bags, polystyrene, synthetic clothing and car tyres creates a majority of the tiny/micro plastics.
		
		A plastic that measures less that 5mm (although there is no minimum size and so can be much smaller – even nanoscopic) are called microplastics. Microplastics known as microbeads found in personal care and cosmetic are also commonly found in the ocean because many of the microbeads are too small to be filtered out by wastewater plants and end up flowing into the ocean. Nurdles are also commonly found in the ocean as millions of them are spilt in factories and other production sites every year and are then often washed into storm drains and then out to sea. Plastic litter is also commonly found in the ocean as it can be carries easily by the wind and rain inti the drainage systems/rivers that flow out to the ocean.
