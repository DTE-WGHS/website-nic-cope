		<p>
		 This page covers a range of things. From why plastics end up in the ocean, how plastic in the ocean effects marine life, to what the most common type of plastic in the ocean is and what happens to the plastic once it’s in the ocean. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Why does plastic end up in the ocean?</h3>
		Plastic can end up in the ocean because of many different factors. One of those many factors can include when plastic is being collected and/or transported to landfill sites. There is a risk that loose plastic could escape into the environment and even when the plastic has been transported to the landfills, the plastic is still at risk of blowing away and ending up in the ocean and/or waterways. Coastal landfill sites are also a high risk for erosion, then all of the buried and loose plastic will end up in the ocean. Much like the West Coast landfill in New Zealand that was exposed to the ocean in a storm.
		<br>
		<br> 
		As plastic packaging is lightweight, it means that it can be easily blown or washed into rivers or drains where it is carried to the sea, or if it isn’t stowed safely by beach goers or members of the community, it may blow directly into the ocean itself. Plastic litter has a higher chance of ending up in the ocean and/or waterways as it can be carried by the wind and rain into the drainage systems or waterways that flow out to the ocean. It has been estimated that major rivers around the world carry approximately 1.15 – 2.41 million tonnes of plastic out to sea. That is the equivalent to around 100,000 rubbish trucks.  
		<br>
		There are two common sources of marine debris/plastic pollution is originating from. The first of the two is land based. This can include things like litter from beach goers (such as leaving bottles, cigarette butts and food packaging) as well as debris that has either been washed in with the stormwater runoff or has been blown into the ocean. The second of the two sources is ocean based. This can include things like garbage disposed at sea by boats and ships, as well as fishing debris such as the plastic strapping from bait boxes, discarded fishing lines or nets, and fishing gear which is in poor condition. Fishing gear and other materials lost at sea by accident, industrial losses or illegal dumping only make up around one fifth (1/5) of the plastic pollution in the ocean whereas roughly 80% of the plastic pollution found in the ocean is from land sources. 
		<br>
		<br>
		The plastic in items such as cotton buds, facewipes and sanitary products that are being flushed down the toilet, and even the plastic fibres that are shed from clothing in the washing machine remain in the water. Also found in personal care and cosmetic products are microplastics known as microbeads. These are washed straight down the drain in products such as shower gels, toothpaste and face scrubs. Because many of these microbeads are too small to be filtered out by the wastewater plants, the plastic particles remain in the water with a high chance of flowing into the ocean.
		<br>
		<br>
		Nurdles: Small pre-production plastic pellets that are roughly the size of lentils. As nurdles are such a small size and because of the way they are transported and handled, millions of the pellets are spilt in factories and other production sites every year. They are then often washed onto storm drains and then out to sea, adding to the often unseen plastic pollution beneath the ocean.
		<br>
		<br>
		Only 9% of plastic is recycled around the world – the other 91% often ends up in landfills or in the ocean and although plastic has been praised for its convenience, it is contributing greatly to larger problems. Adding to the already huge problem of plastic pollution in the ocean and creating the next generation to be a throw-away, disposable society, and the planet is struggling to support it. An estimated $13 billion dollars in losses each year can be linked to marine plastic debris due to the negative impact on the marine ecosystems.
		<br>
		<h3>What happens to plastic once it’s in the ocean?</h3>
		As plastic is so durable, it means that it doesn’t biodegrade in the ocean. It is known to be photodegradable. This means that they just break up into smaller and smaller pieces when they are exposed to sunlight. As the temperature of the ocean to which they are exposed to is much lower than the temperature on land, the process of breaking down takes much longer in the ocean and then stays there for centuries as a result. During the process of breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces, some of the plastic floats to the surface easily, many surface feeding animals – including fish and seabirds – often mistake it for food. As seabirds are then feeding those plastic pellets to their chicks which then results in the death of those chicks. That can then ultimately cause the decrease in population numbers for the affected species and fewer and fewer chicks are successfully being raised.

		<p>Plastic is a major issue – especially in parts of the developing world, third world countries and large open ocean gyres where the ocean currents meet and all that they carry accumulates. Ocean currents have also been found to carry plastic all over the world, and even uninhibited pacific islands and the arctic are becoming plastic dumping grounds. Eventually many large plastic items will wash up on beaches, despite the plastic hotspots in ocean gyres. 
		<br>
		<br>
		All throughout the marine environment plastic can be found. From coastlines and lagoons that are near shore, to remote hotspots in the ocean where plastics that are caught in up ocean currents can be gathered together into huge ‘garbage patches’ that swirl on the ocean surface to many metres below. Plastic is even being found on polar ice.
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>How does the plastic in the ocean affect marine life?</h3>
		Over 500 marine species are now known to be affected by plastic pollution. Discarded fishing gear only comprises of 20% of all marine debris but it takes its toll on the marine environment by entangling sea life and destroying/damaging coral reefs. Shockingly, land based sources make up the other 80% of marine debris. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Things like entanglement and choking tend to be obvious and visible harmful effects of large items of plastic on marine life. It is the microplastics that present more insidious, different threats to the healthy functioning of marine ecosystems and this could ultimately prove to have far greater damage and be more widespread. Even the smallest particles can and are being absorbed by the species at the bottom of the food chain. There has even been microfibres from synthetic clothing found in zooplankton. Nurdles are also readily eaten by fish, seabirds and other marine life as they are often mistaken for small items of food, such as fish eggs. Microplastics are being found in seafood and the plastic can even accumulate as it is passed up the food chain, and this isn’t helped by the wide range of species that are able to consume the plastic fragments because of their small size. Microplastics can be potentially more hazardous to any animal that eats them, including those species higher up in the food chain as they can also attract and absorb toxins from the marine environment surrounding them. There is also potential for the plastic contaminants to be transferred to us if the seafood we are eating ingests plastic.
		<br>
		<br>
		Entanglement or ingesting plastic means that many species are dying a slow and agonizing death as a result. Marine turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and ingest it, whereas seabirds and other marine animals mistake small items such as gas lighters or plastic pellets in different stages of decomposition for food.
