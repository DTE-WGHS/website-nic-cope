		Plastics in the ocean. We all know that it is a bad thing, but somehow more and more plastic is ending up there. This website was created to help inform people about the reality of plastics in the ocean and how we can reduce our plastic intake and out-put to help slow down the quantity of plastic that is entering the ocean each year until there is hardly any. This website also highlights the issue of plastics in the ocean - the facts and harsh reality of what is happening right now. It includes both sides of this issue: what will happen if we don’t start reducing our single-use plastic consumption and continue to dispose irresponsibly, and what will happen if we do reduce our single-use plastic consumption and find responsible ways to dispose of them. Also included is how the plastics are impacting and effecting the marine species and their environments. 
		<br>
		If people are well informed, aware of the situation and how to solve the problem, then I think that we would have greater impact and success by massively reducing the amount of single-use non-recyclable plastics going into the ocean. 
		<br>
		<br> 
		So, who does it involve and what does it look like? Plastics in the ocean involves everybody. From the manufacturer down to the consumer. It involves the manufacturer as they are making the plastics that they use for/in their products and aiming to make them recyclable and/or able to be used more than once. It also involves the consumer responsibly disposing of their plastics. It involves consumers, manufacturers and any person that walks past a piece of plastic and ignores it. 
		<br>
		Once the plastic is in the ocean, it is able to travel anywhere and everywhere on ocean currents - what we do in New Zealand doesn’t just stay in New Zealand, it is also impacting the rest of the world and vice versa.
		<br>
		<br>
		What is being or has been done? Single-use plastic bags have been phased out of all shops in New Zealand. If plastic bags are being made, they are being made durable so that they can be used again for different purposes, biodegradable and shops offer material or paper bags as an alternative. Shops found to be distributing plastic bags can be fined up to $100,000.
		<br>
		<br>
		There are many different perspectives on the issue of plastics in the ocean and how to deal with plastic pollution that occurs in the ocean. Some believe that recycling is solution, whereas others believe that recycling is not enough of a solution and that more needs to be done. No matter what you believe the solution is, we all need to do our part for reducing the plastic that is being consumed that is ending up in the ocean and in landfills.
		<br>
		<br>
		I think that one of the things that confuses us is the word biodegradable. Some things can be labelled as biodegradable but take decades to breakdown and other things that are labelled biodegradable can take just weeks or months to break down. We need a clear and concise definition of the word biodegradable.

		It is important to be aware of what is going on in the world around us. I believe that plastic pollution in the ocean is a massive problem and probably won’t be able to be fixed completely, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try to reduce the problem and the rate at which it is happening as much as we can.
		<br>
		<br>
		People would also be more inclined to be responsibe about the plastics they are using and how they are disposing of the plastic once it is used. The more people that are aware and informed on this issue and that are willing to make a change, the more of a chance we have to reduce the issue of plastic pollution in the ocean.
