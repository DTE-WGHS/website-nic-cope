	  <h2>NEW ZEALAND REDUCTION</h2> <!-- this tells the website that this is the second largest heading on this website page -->
	</center>
		

	<div class="col-1">
		<p>This page covers three things. What New Zealand can do and has done to reduce single-use plastics from reaching the ocean, and what communities (especially sea-side communities) can do to stop single-use plastics from reaching the ocean.
		<br>
		<br>
		Some background information about New Zealand first. New Zealand - located in the South Pacific Ocean and the Tasman sea - has an area of 268,021 km2, a population of 4.886 million and is part of the Australasia/Oceania Continent. New Zealand is also located on the Pacific Ring of Fire. New Zealand is the first country in the world to see the sunrise and is where ‘The Lord of the Rings’ was filmed. 
		<br>
		<h3>So, what is being done to stop plastics from reaching the oceans in New Zealand?</h3>	
		12 companies, from food stores and brands to post companies, even to makeup companies, have signed the New Zealand Plastic Declaration to have packaging that is 100% recyclable by 2025. Three food stores – Countdown, Fresh Choice and SuperValue – all phased out plastic straws by October 2018 and they are now moving towards being 100% reusable/recyclable/compostable packaging by at least 2025. Countdown alone would be removing 11.6 million plastic straws from landfills and the ocean by phasing them out. 
		<br>
		<br>
		For New Zealand, the microbead ban is a great start and will cause a decrease in the number of microplastics entering the ocean and waterways each year because every little bit counts towards the bigger picture of reducing all types of plastics in the ocean. Businesses throughout New Zealand have had to phase out single-use plastic bags from their stores to more eco-friendly alternatives. If businesses are found to be distributing them, they can be fined up to $100,000.
		<br>
		<h3>What about communities – especially seaside communities? What can they do to stop plastic pollution from reaching the ocean and waterways?</h3>
		As change isn’t just needed at an individual level, it also needs to come from the industries and from local governments. Coastal and riverside communities are found to contribute a significant amount of the plastic pollution that is ending up in the ocean.
		<br>
		Litter from beach goers as well as debris that has either been washed in with the stormwater/drain runoff or has been blown in the ocean are just some of the many examples of land-based sources of plastic pollution in the ocean.
		<br>
		<br>
		In many countries, local beach clean ups are regular occurrences and are a popular activity to choose to get the whole community involved. Other things that local councils can do to contribute to the solution could be that they provide enclosed rubbish and recycling facilities for beach goers big enough to cater for crowds that could potentially gather as well as enforcing penalties for littering and illegal dumping. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Something that individuals can do in those coastal or riverside communities is spend three minutes picking up trash/plastic waste from the beach/waterway before surfing, diving or swimming. Or take a bag while you go for a walk so that you can pick up anything that doesn’t belong on the waterfront.

		<p><h3>What can New Zealand do to further reduce plastic pollution and production?</h3>
		Globally, the plastic that is produced adds up to approximately 300 million tonnes. Around 50% of all that – including plastic that manufacturers use to produce their products – is discarded after it is first used.
		<br>
		<br>
		New Zealand is heading in the right direction, but more needs to be done. An increase in consumerism as well as the number of plastics used to manufacture our everyday products is contributing to the global problem of plastic pollution which is growing exponentially. We are needing to use less plastic, but we also need to produce less and throw away less plastic too. This means that we need to not only make an individual change but also changes in the industrial processes and the government policies – in New Zealand and around the world.
		<br>
		<br>
		To end or even reduce the amount of plastics in the ocean we need corporates to reduce the quantity of single-use plastics that they are selling so that we as consumers can cut down on the amount of plastic that is being thrown away at the same time.
