		<p>
		Included in this page are things that you can do as an individual to change your personal habits concerning the use of single-use plastics to help reduce the issue of plastic pollution in the ocean. 
		<br>
		<br>
		To change, we need to start with ourselves and our habits. We can do our best to avoid buying items that are wrapped in plastic (for example, buying loose fruit instead of pre-packaged fruit) and use reusable produce/shopping bags. Keeping one in the car, handbag, work bag or jacket pocket are good places to keep them to avoid forgetting them. They are cheap and you can now also buy foldable/pocket options as well if you are short on space. Instead of buying new items and/or throwing old items away, we can think of ways to upcycle them and educate ourselves on recycling items properly and responsibly. You can also increase your impact for the cause by supporting charities that are addressing plastic pollution and signing petitions for plastic bans.
		<br>
		<br> 
		<br>
		Every year, over 2 billion razors end up in landfills and the ocean. This means the plastic handle is breaking down into smaller and smaller plastic pieces which is then posing a danger to the wildlife and marine life as well as the environment. To combat and reduce this, we can use a razor with disposable blades instead of disposable razors.  
		<br>
		<br>
		By making your own deodorant, you are using more sustainable ways to stop your sweat and its smell. The deodorant and its container pose a similar danger as the razor because it cannot be recycled – making your own reduces that danger.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the UK, over 1.2 billion metres of cling wrap is used. By removing this and using eco-friendly options such as beeswax wraps, vegan wax wraps and Tupperware containers for food storage and/or for on the go, you are removing the risk of chemicals being released and sinking into the groundwater supply or the ocean. The risk of chemicals being released is caused by cling wrap being very difficult to recycle and taking hundreds of years to break down. 
		<br>
		<br>
		500 million drinking straws a used by Americans every day. Now translate that to include the rest of the world. For those people who really love having a straw, you can carry a stainless steel metal straw with you. There are also compactable/foldable straws or even biodegradable straws made from things like bamboo or wheat to choose from. 
		<br>
		<br>
		To avoid buying bottled water, you can buy a good quality water filter and a reusable water bottle. Bottles made from stainless steel or glass are good options, or there are collapsible options for those who prefer less space to be taken up. If you do have to buy a bottle of water, keep the bottle and reuse it or recycle it responsibly. This is similar to buying takeout food or food on the go. You could eat in or take a lunchbox with you to reduce your use of disposable cutlery, plates and packaging – and where possible, always recycle responsibly.

		When going to get a takeaway coffee/tea/drink, take a re-usable cup with you. You can find options such as bamboo, collapsible silicon, glass or even reusable hard plastic cups. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Shampoo bars last longer than bottled shampoo and they don’t have the plastic packaging. They are still retaining your natural hair oils, beneficial for your hair in the long term and are an easy way to cut down on plastic. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Another way to cut down on your plastic intake/output is to switch to an eco-toothbrush. Switching to an eco-friendly version such as a bamboo toothbrush is the energy saving alternative to the plastic brush, and the handles are 100% bamboo. This means that they can be disposed of, and as they are completely biodegradable, they will not pose a danger or cause harm to marine/wild life or to the environment. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Where possible, switch to milk, stock and fruit juice that is packages in glass bottles. Glass is 100% recyclable whereas around 9% of plastics can be recycled with the other 91% often ending up in the ocean or in landfills. 
		<br>
		<br>
		A single fleece jacket can release around 20 million plastic fibres in a standard wash once study found. To prevent microfibres from entering the ocean and our food chain, we can wear clothing made from non-synthetic, natural materials. Things like organic cotton, silk and linin for example.
		<br>
		<br>
		Spending 3 minutes picking up trash from the beach/waterway before surfing, diving or swimming as well as being involved in beach/river clean-ups in the way of organisation or participation are also quick and easy ways to individually and collectively help reduce the plastics in the ocean.
